This directory contains the examples from the Third Edition of the book
"Java in a Nutshell" by David Flanagan.  They were written by David
Flanagan, and are Copyright (c) 1999 by O'Reilly & Associates.  You may
distribute these examples in source-code form for non-commercial
purposes only.  You may study, modify, and use these examples for any
purpose. Note, however, that these examples are provided "as is", and
come with NO WARRANTY of any kind either expressed or implied.

The filenames identify each example by its chapter number and example
number.  Example 1-1 is a complete Java program, and is also provided in
a file named Factorial.java.  As explained in Chapter 1, you can compile
and run this program with commands like these:

	 javac Factorial.java
	 java Factorial 4

None of the remaining examples have main() methods, so they are not
complete programs, and can not be run by themselves.  Many of these
examples do define Java classes, and, if appropriately renamed, they can
be compiled, and used by other Java classes.  (Although none of them are
particularly useful!).  Other examples are simply code fragments, which
can be incorporated into other Java code, but which cannot be compiled
as is.
